          <p class="post-text">Quite a good question, huh? What do I mean, when i'm talking about the best food
            in the world. Does it mean best-tasting, most enjoyable or just the best food for 
            body and soul? Well, wouldn't it be great to have all in one? I truely believe that we
            can get all of these pleasures at once. Most important of all is that we love handling
            the food, we are eating. It should be fun preparing tasty meals and the portions should
            be big enough, so we don't have to restrict ourselves. Being hungry all the time can be
            very exhausting. Therefore we want foods which are not that calory-dense, taste good and
            satisfy our needs of nutrients. Depending on our activity-rate throughout the day its is
            appropriate to add more calory-dense but still healthy energy sources, so we don't have 
            to eat for the most time we are not active.
