        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="post-text">Quite a good question, huh? What do I mean, when i'm talking about the best food
            in the world. Does it mean best-tasting, most enjoyable or just the best food for 
            body and soul? Well, wouldn't it be great to have all in one? I truely believe that we
            can get all of these pleasures at once. Most important of all is that we love handling
            the food, we are eating. It should be fun preparing tasty meals and the portions should
            be big enough, so we don't have to restrict ourselves. Being hungry all the time can be
            very exhausting. Therefore we want foods which are not that calory-dense, taste good and
            satisfy our needs of nutrients. Depending on our activity-rate throughout the day its is
            appropriate to add more calory-dense but still healthy energy sources, so we don't have 
            to eat for the most time we are not active.

        <h3 class="post-title">Why everyone should be concerned about nutrition!?</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="post-text">Hey fellows, in today's post I want to talk about the attitude in
            the common population towards nutrition. How is it possible, that so many people don't
            know what they are doing to their body when eating fast and junk food every day? In first
            place there isn't much education about nutrition in the school systems of the western
            world. Even medical students are roughly taught about this subject. Additionally there is a
            billion-dollar industry behind most of the junk foods many people eat. They will try everything
            to confuse the crowd, so they stick to their bad habits. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing
            about eating some popcorn in cinema or having some noodles from the asia imbiss while traveling.
            In the end it's our day to day choices which determine, how healthy we end up next month, year
            or ten years from now. For that reason at TFR we try to support you with useful information
            and thoughts about how you can take the next step into the right direction, so you will be able
            to perform mentally and physically at your best.
